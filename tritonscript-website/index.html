       <p>Welcome to the CSES Open Source Class Notes Repository Project! This repository is a collaborative effort undertaken by the Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSES) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD)
       <br /><br />Our goal is to create a platform where every CSES member can actively contribute to building a valuable resource for UCSD students. We aim to develop a community-driven forum for sharing class notes and educational resources. This project encompasses the following key features:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Repository of Class Notes:</strong> A central repository where students can share their class notes and resources</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile App & Website:</strong> Accessible through both a mobile app and a web platform for seamless usability.</li>
        <li><strong>UCSD Credentials Login:</strong> Securely log in using your UCSD credentials to ensure the authenticity of contributors.</li>
        <li><strong>Course Contributions:</strong> Any student can add a class they've taken and contribute by uploading their class notes.</li>
        <li><strong>Mega-Repository:</strong> A centralized hub with notes for various classes that anyone can contribute to.</li>
        <li><strong>NLP Integration:</strong> Potential integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert handwritten text to PDFs, verify uploaded documents, and more.</li>
       </ul>
